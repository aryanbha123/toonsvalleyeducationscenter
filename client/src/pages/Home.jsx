          The Tons Valley Education Trust, also known as <b>Sunny's Amanat</b>, was founded in 2006 by Mr. Sunny Singh. Its primary objective is the upliftment of the girl child by providing assistance in computer literacy and English language to underprivileged children in the area. Since his passing in 2012, his son, Mr. Aditya Singh, has been carrying forward this vision with enthusiastic sincerity.

          The Trust provides stationery, school bags, umbrellas in the monsoon; thermals, socks and woolens in winter. It has an enviable library of books and a full-fledged computer lab.

            Though Sunny Singh died in December last year, his legacy Guniyal Gaon Education Centre for girls continues to flourish. His son Aditya Singh, a senior Delhi banker, is its president now. Zarine Bath has since been running the school with her usual aplomb.
